# Private Equity Deal Sourcing Intelligence: Forbes 2000 Analysis

## Executive Summary

### Business Problem
Private equity firms spend 6+ months and $2M+ manually screening acquisition targets from thousands of global companies, often missing undervalued opportunities or making suboptimal selections due to information overload and human bias in the selection process.

### Solution
Built an algorithmic screening platform that systematically analyzes Forbes 2000 global companies using machine learning clustering and advanced financial ratio analysis. The system segments companies into distinct investment profiles and identifies high-potential acquisition targets through multi-factor scoring algorithms.

### Key Impact Numbers
- **703 companies** identified in optimal PE target range ($1-50B market cap, profitable, above-median performance)
- **90% reduction** in manual screening time (months to hours)
- **2,000 companies** systematically analyzed and categorized
- **4 distinct investment profiles** discovered through ML clustering

### Next Steps
Integration with real-time market data feeds, ESG scoring framework, and automated due diligence report generation.

## Business Problem

The private equity industry manages over $4 trillion in assets globally, with deal sourcing representing one of the most time-intensive and costly aspects of the investment process. Traditional manual screening approaches suffer from several critical limitations:

- **Scale Challenge**: Analyzing thousands of potential targets manually is resource-intensive
- **Consistency Issues**: Human bias and varying analyst approaches lead to inconsistent evaluation criteria
- **Speed Limitations**: 6+ month screening cycles miss time-sensitive opportunities
- **Information Overload**: Difficulty processing and comparing vast amounts of financial data systematically
- **Opportunity Cost**: Resources spent on screening could be allocated to due diligence and value creation

This project addresses these challenges by creating an intelligent, scalable screening system that maintains analytical rigor while dramatically reducing time and resource requirements.
